.SH NAME
party \- set OS responses mode
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B party ON|OFF|WHEREIS [ - ] dnv
.SH DESCRIPTION
Operating  systems  being  what they are,  the admin people can
easily  grow tired of  command responses that resemble dyslexic
eugene-speak   filtered   through   Kernighan   and   Ritchie's
collective  back-brains.  To alleviate this, we have included a
slightly  more  `casual'  mode,  in  which the responses to all
commands  are  first filtered  through  a  customising  routine
.B (DUDE)
, which  makes them  sound a little more  friendly while retaining
their  full  information   content  (usually).   The rooted(c)
system prompt is  changed to  `What now,  dude?' and output from
each command is terminated by `No problem, dude.'
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose mode  (ALL commands  have  a `verbose' mode). When  this  option
is  present,  all filtered responses are  preceeded  by a message:
`This response has been parsed by the
.B DUDE
filter and is not intended to be some sort of sleazy come-on.'
.TP
.B \-d
Don't  restart  all  processes  after  recompiling the
.B /uselss/libs/eugene
file (see below).   This alows any important tasks to complete beforehand.
.TP
.B \-n
Notify  all  users  that  they  are about to be force-logged out and
force-logged in again.
.TP
.B ON
Activates the
.B DUDE
filter.
.TP
.B OFF
De-activates the
.B DUDE
filter.
.TP
.B WHEREIS
Doesn't do anything, but we couldn't resist it.
.SH EXAMPLES
.ft C
%-)  party on

What now, dude?

.ft TR
To compare  the differing responses, here is output provided by the
ispi -s command, with party OFF and party ON:

.SH BUGS
The
.B \-n
option can be slow.

may not  receive the  `warning, restart imminent' message until
after the restart.

There is no way selectively to follow symbolic links.
